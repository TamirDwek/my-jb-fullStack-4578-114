        <p>Boxing gloves are essential equipment in the sport of boxing. They are designed to protect both the boxer's hands and their opponent's head during a fight. The gloves are made with a thick layer of padding, typically made from horsehair or foam, which absorbs the impact of punches. The outer shell is usually made of leather or synthetic materials, providing durability and protection. Boxing gloves come in various sizes and weights, depending on the boxer's weight class and the specific training or competition requirements.</p>

        <p>MMA gloves are designed for mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions and training. They are typically smaller and have less padding than traditional boxing gloves, allowing for more flexibility and a wider range of techniques. MMA gloves often feature a more open-fingered design or a partially closed-finger design, providing greater dexterity for grappling and submissions. The padding is strategically placed to protect the hands and knuckles while still allowing for effective strikes.</p>

        <p>Leg shields are protective gear used in various martial arts and combat sports to safeguard the legs from injuries. They are typically made of durable materials like leather or synthetic fibers, and often incorporate padding for shock absorption. Leg shields come in different styles and sizes, ranging from full-length coverage to shorter versions that focus on protecting the shins. They are commonly used in sports like Muay Thai, kickboxing, and Taekwondo, where leg strikes and kicks are a significant part of the competition.</p>
